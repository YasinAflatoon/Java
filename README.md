# Java

> This repository is for writing down my lessons in `Java`. I may need this later.  

Currently, my sources are [Marcus Beil Video](https://youtu.be/grEKMHGYyns) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java) and I may add my notes at university too.

Java is a powerful programming language with great community support which can be used for many purposes and it is Object-Oriented.
