> This repository is for writing down my lessons in `Java`. I may need this later.  

Currently my sources are: [Marcus Beil Video](https://youtu.be/grEKMHGYyns) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java) and i may add my notes at university too.

Java is a powerful programming language with a great commiunity support which can be used in many purposes and it is Object-Oreiented.
