# Keep Things Clean

Before we head to learning, I want to talk about something important here. In programming, it is highly recommended to write your code in a clean and readable way. To do that, you need to keep an eye on something, called: Indentation.

## Indentation

Indentation refers to putting spaces in some lines, to specify some piece of code, or show if a code is a subset of another part.

> Indentation is recommended in methods, classes, condition statements, and some other stuff that you'll see later.

But currently, you don't need to care a lot about indentations, because the IDE you're using is probably helping you with that. As an instance, if you define your main method then you hit enter, IntelliJ will put the cursor with some spaces in the next line.

As you see, line 3 is started with some spaces and if we add some code in the main method, it would be easy for the reader to understand, this code is a subset for the main method, and the main method itself is a subset for our class "App".

You may think indentation pattern is hard to follow, so here is a very simple and useful way to make sure your code is clean:

In IntelliJ, there is a shortcut "`Ctrl(or Command)` + `Alt` + `L`" which will fix your indentations automatically and you don't need to spend too much time on it.

## Theme

Many people (me included) like to use their IDE on a black screen with some colored texts to feel that "programming vibe". if you are one of those, good news for you! IDEs provide many themes and plugins so you can download them and apply them to your IDE and don't worry if you are not satisfied with your current IDE appearance.

In IntelliJ, to download a theme, click on the "Setting icon" top right corner of the screen and then select "Theme". You'll see some preloaded themes and at the bottom of the list, click on "Install Theme" on you'll see a lot of themes that are available for you. You can preview them and download your desired one.

> * To apply a theme go to the previously mentioned section, (Setting Icon/Theme) and click on your preferred theme.
> * The theme I'm using is "One Dark theme" created by "Mark Skelton"
