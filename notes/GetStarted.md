# Get Started

The first step in writing a Java code is installing [`JDK`](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) (stands for Java Development Kit), which is basically what we need for debugging and executing our java code.

> JDK contains all standard libraries, Java Runtime Environment (`JRE`), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (`javac`), and other tools needed in Java development.

After installing JDK, it's time to Choose an IDE (stands for Integrated Development Environment).

> IDE is basically is a place where you can do whatever you like to your code, like Editing, Debugging, or Running.

There are too many IDEs in the market and honestly, it doesn't matter which one you choose, because they are gonna do the same things for you.
There are some options out there like: [`IntelliJ`](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), [`Eclipse`](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), and [`NetBeans`](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html), I use IntelliJ you can choose whatever you feel comfortable with.

Remember choosing an IDE is not a big deal and you can move on to another one very quickly. So don't get too obsessed with them and try to focus on **learning**.

> The best IDE is the one that maximizes your productivity.

and now you are ready to write your first Java program!
